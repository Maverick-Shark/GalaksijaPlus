# Galaksija FPGA core for Poseidon-EP4CGX150 (WIP)

This port has been made thanks to the following sources: 

It is mainly based on the corresponding core for MiST created by [Gehstock](https://github.com/Gehstock/Mist_FPGA/tree/master/Computer_MiST/Galaksija_MiST).

Several elements such as the keyboard handling have been added from [hrvach](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Galaksija_MiSTer)'s port to MiSTer.

The ROM D addition is based on [GALe - Galaksija Emulator](https://galaksija.net/)*

Finally, several improvements have been migrated from the respective port for the Senhor board. (MiSTer clone)
